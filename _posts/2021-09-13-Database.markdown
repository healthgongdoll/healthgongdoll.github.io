### **Overview of Database Design Process** <br/>


Two main activities: <br/>
	- Database Design <br/>
	- Application Design <br/>
<br/>
**Diagram for Database Design**

<br/>
1. First of all, take the user requirement from the user requirement <br/>
2. Identify what are data requirements for the application <br/>
3. Design the **Conceptual Design** (Work with the model DBMS independent) <br/>
4. Conceptual design forwarded to the logical design which is Database specific (So it can be implemented) <br/>
<br/>

**ER Modeling**  <br/>
- A database **Conceptual Schema** in the ER model can be represented pictorially (ER diagrams). <br/>
- ER diagram can be converted into a Logical Schema based on relational data model. <br/>
<br/>

**Example of Company Database** <br/>
- We need to create a database schema design based on following **Requirements** of the COMPANY database: <br/>
	1. The company is oranized into **Departments**. Each department has a <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'>Name, Number, and an employee </mark> who manages the department <br/>
		We keep track of the <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'>start date of the department manager. A department may have several locations.</mark>  <br/>
	2. Each department controls a number of **Projects**. Each project has a <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'>unique name, unique number and is located at a single location. </mark> <br/>
	3. The database will store each **Employee**'s <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'> social Security Number, address, salary, sex, and birthdate.</mark>  <br/>
		- Each employee works for one department but may work on several projects <br/>
		- The DB will keep track of the number of hours per week that an employee currently works on each project. <br/>
		- It is required to keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee. <br/>
	4. Each employee may have a number of **DEPENDENTs**. <br/>
		- For each dependent, <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'>the DB keeps record of name, sex, birthdate, and relationship to the employee.</mark> <br/>
<br/>

**ER Model Concepts**<br/>
Entities and Attributes: <br/>
<br/>
	- Entities are specific things or objects in the mini-world that are represented in the database. <br/>
		- Ex) The Employee John Smith, the Research Department <br/>
	- Attributes are properties used to describe an entity. <br/>
		- Ex) Employee entity have attributes: NAME, SSN, Address, Sex, BirthDate <br/>
	- A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes. <br/>
		- Ex) Name = "John Smith", SSN="1234567", Sex="M",BirthDate="1996.01.01" <br/>
	- Each Attribute has a value set (or data type or domain associated with it) <br/>
<br/>
**Entity Type and Key Attribute** <br/>
Entities with the **same basic attributes** are grouped into an **entity type**. <br/>
	- Ex) The entity type EMPLOYEE and PROJECT (Groups together based on similar attribute) <br/>
An attribute of an entity type for which each entity must have <mark style='background-color: #fff5b1'>  a unique value is called a key attribute </mark> of the entity type. <br/>
	- EX) SSN of Employee <br/>
<br/>

**Entity Set**
Each entity type will have a collection of entities stored in the database <br/>
		- Called the entity set or sometimes entity collection <br/>
		- How many entities we have of that particular kind <br/>
Entity set is the current state of the entities of that type that are stored in the database <br/>
<br/>

**Types of Attributes** <br/>
1. Simple: <br/>
	- Each entity has a single atomic value for the attribute. EX) SSN or Sex <br/>
2. Composite: <br/>
	- The attribute may be composed of several components. EX) Address(Apt#, Street, City, State, ZipCode, Country)/ Name(First, Last Name), may form a hierarchy <br/>
3. Multi-valued: <br/>
	- An entity may have multiple values for that attribute. EX) color of a CAR or Previous Degrees of a Student. (Denoted as \{Color\}) <br/>
<br/>

**Entity Types and Key Attributes** <br/>
A **Key Attribute** may be **Composite** <br/>
	- VehicleTagNumber is a key of CAR entity type with compoents (Number, State) <br/>
An **Entity type** may have more than **one key** <br/>
	- The CAR entity type may have two keys: VehicalIdentificationNumber, VehicleTagNumber(Number,State) <br/>
