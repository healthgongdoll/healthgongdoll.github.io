### **Data Communication** <br/>
 
 Data communication is the **exchange of data between two devices** via some **Transmission Media.** Four Characteristics are: <br/>
	- **Delivery:** send data to correct destination <br/>
	- **Accuracy:** Analog Data, Digital Data (Microphone, Keyboards) <br/>
	- **Timeliness:** Data to be on time (Time sensitive: Electronic Gaming, Zoom, Web Surfing, Time insensitive) <br/>
	- **Jitter:** Variation in the packet arrival time (One packet is comming 30s, 40s, 50s,... It is the **Variation time of those delays** (Not the Delays)) <br/>
	Without these 4 characteristics of Communication data is useless <br/>

**Components**<br/>
A data communications system has **five components**: <br/>
1. Message <br/>
2. Sender <br/>
3. Receiver <br/>

	- **Text** is represented as a **bit pattern using UNICODE** (Translate character to Unicode bit Pattern 32bit per Character) <br/>
	- **Numbers** are represented in **binary** <br/>
	- **Images** are represented as bit patterns using either **RGB or CMY**<br/>
	- **Audio** refers to the **recording or broadcating** of sound or music, represented as analog or digital signals <br/>
	- **Videos** can be **continous images** or a **combination of images** <br/>  
<br/>
