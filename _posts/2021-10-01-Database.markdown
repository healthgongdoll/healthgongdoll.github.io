### **Definition** <br/>


Based on the concept of a Relation<br/>
A relation looks like a table of values<br/>
(Relation is a table (Collection of Tuples) and Tuple is just a row)<br/>
   - Contains a set of rows, formally called **tuples**<br/>
      - Each row represents certain facts that correspond to a real-world entity or relationship<br/>
   - Column header/name indicates the meaning of the data items in that column <br/>
      - Column header is formally called an attribute name (or just attribute) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**Example of a Relation** <br/>

<br/>

**Key of a Relation**
- Each row has a value of data item (or set of items) that uniquely identifies that row in the table <br/>
   - **The Key** (Distinguish one tuple from other) <br/>
   - **In the STUDENT table, SSN is the key** <br/>
- Sometimes row-ids or sequential numbers are assigned as keys to identify the rows in table <br/>
<br/>

**Schema** <br/>
<br/>

The **Schema** (or description) of a Relation: <br/>
- Denoted by R(A1,A2,...An)<br/>
- **R** is the name of the relation, attributes of the relation are **A1,A2,...An** <br/>
- Example: CUSTOMER(cust-id,Cust-name,Address,Phone#)<br/>
- A **Tuple** is an ordered set of values (When you specify the value) <br/>
   - <632895,"John Smith", "101 Main St. Atlanta, GA 30332","(404) 892 2000"> <br/>
- A relation is a **Set** of such tuples (rows) <br/>
<br/>

**Characteristics Of Relations** <br/>
<br/>

Ordering of tuples in a relation instance (state): <br/>
   - The tuples **are not considered to be ordered**<br/>
Ordering of attributes in relation schema R(and of values within each tuptle): <br/>
   - Depends on the notation <br/>
      - R(A1,A2,...An) <br/>
      - T= {<name,"John">, <SSN,123456789>} <br/>
